# Age-Invarient-Face-Recognization-AIFR
-->PCA-for dimensionality reduction. -->LBP- it's efficient in the illumination, rotation, and grayscale variance -->WHT- Walsh-Hadamard Transform(WHT) for orthogonal transformation is used for feature extraction. Before applying LBP here I applied the first Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) for orthogonal transformation. -->link of the paper for whole process flow: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Priyanka_Patel8/publication/315892151_Investigate_Age_Invariant_Face_Recognition_Using_PCA_LBP_Walsh_Hadamard_Transform_with_Neural_Network/links/58ec89e40f7e9b6b274bb17c/Investigate-Age-Invariant-Face-Recognition-Using-PCA-LBP-Walsh-Hadamard-Transform-with-Neural-Network.pdf  To learn more about the background of the dataset, and the AIFR  you must visit the : https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3626589220394005192&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2005 You must cite this paper if you use: Patel, P., and A.
